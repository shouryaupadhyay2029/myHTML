CLIENT-SERVER COMMUNICATION
  -> THE BROWSER WE USE TO MAKE A REQUEST IS CALLED CLIENT AND THE POINT FROM WHERE 
    WE GET RESPONSE IS SERVER
  ->  eg:  doctor is server and patient is client
  ->  server only provides specific type of services
  ->  steps:
      1 client finds need of a server\
      2 client finds a relevant server
      3 client gets close to server to create COMMUNICATION channel
      4 client makes REQUEST
      5 server procsses the REQUEST
      6 server responds to client

INTERNET AND IP
  -> network is interconnection of computers
  -> internet is a global network to which all computer inworld can be conncected
  -> every device connected to the internet has a unique ip adress due to which no website gets mixed up
  -> DNS(DOMAIN NAME SERVERQ) maintains the table that maps the website nameto their respective ip adress pf their corresponding computer
  -> so refined COMMUNICATION between client and server is:
     1) client finds the need of SERVER
     2 client finds a relevant server by dns lookup which provides ip adress of browser 
       then connects to the corresponding server 
     3)client then sends the request to web server called http request and
    server responds called http responds
